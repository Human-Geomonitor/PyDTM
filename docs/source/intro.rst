IOM's DTM API
*************

To simplify and modernize the data-sharing platform for IDPs, DTM has created a publicly accessible API. This API allows the humanitarian community, academia, media, government, and non-governmental organizations to utilize the data collected by DTM. The DTM API only provides non-sensitive IDP figures, aggregated at the country, Admin 1 (states, provinces, or equivalent), and Admin 2 (smaller subnational administrative areas) levels.

The data is stored at the country, Admin 1 (states, provinces or equivalent) and Admin 2 (smaller subnational administrative areas) levels.

********************

The DTM API is a powerful tool for accessing data from the IOM's Displacement Tracking Matrix, but it is not very user-friendly. ``pydtm`` is a python package wrapping IOM's DTM API which aims to allow researchers to easily access the data from a Python environment.
